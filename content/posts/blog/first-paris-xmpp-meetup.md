After Berlin, Stockholm, and London, here is Paris. The trend of new XMPP meetups in major cities in Europe is confirmed.

The Paris meetup is simply organised by the JabberFr community, as this will be mostly oriented discussions on modern XMPP/Jabber.

Details are available on [JabberFr](https://news.jabberfr.org/2017/03/rencontre-xmpp-le-mardi-28-mars-2017-a-paris/), [LinuxFr.org](https://linuxfr.org/news/rencontre-xmpp-jabber-par-jabberfr-mardi-28-mars-2017-a-19-h-a-paris), and [agendadulibre](http://www.agendadulibre.org/events/13494).
